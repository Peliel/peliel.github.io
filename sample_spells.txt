SAMPLE SPELLS

Where shadow walks and echoes play, vanish with the light of day.

Paint my foes with twisted grace, let terror dance across their face

Arise, defender, forged from dust—Stand ‘til break or turn to rust.

By sun unchained and comet’s scream, ignite the world with crimson gleam.

Still the blood and halt the breath, bind the soul in winter's death.

Ash to ash and steel to flame, burn the sky and mark my name!

Feathered breath and skyward thread, lift me where the clouds have bled.
