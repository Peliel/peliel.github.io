# Custom Magic System Info

The test UI behind the link is trained to turn poetry into pre-determined spells with different parameters. Try it out with different poems and see how  
big of a greatness-score you can achieve. Sufficiently great poems can even have multiple effects at once.

Enter your input to the input field on the left and then press **Submit**. Spell incantations can also be saved to memory. Note that all user inputs are printed to our console, that is, we can see them. We are not going to save those, but we can see them.

The model is trained only on English language.

Currently spells with greatness > 10 increase your aura, and if the spell is a hp spell (in case of hp, greatness = 10 makes a minor increment; aura is not affected), it increases your hp. On the other hand spells with greatness < 10 decrease your aura and if the spell is an hp spell, it also makes a minor deduction to your hp ("spell was cringe and failed").

Unfortunately, due to limited time, we had to resort to a less optimized model with response time around 10 seconds. Upgrading to ExLlamaV2 models, **the response time would go down to 1-2 seconds**.
