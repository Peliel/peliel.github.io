# Custom Magic System Info

The test UI behind the link is trained to turn poetry into pre-determined spells with different parameters. Try it out with different poems and see how  
big of a greatness-score you can achieve. Sufficiently great poems can even have multiple effects at once.

Enter your input to the input field on the left and then press **Submit**. Spell incantations can also be saved to memory.

The model is trained only on English language.

Currently spells with greatness > 10 increase your aura, and if the spell is a hp spell (in case of hp, greatness = 10 makes a minor increment; aura is not affected), it increases your hp. On the other hand spells with greatness < 10 decrease your aura and if the spell is an hp spell, it also makes a minor deduction to your hp ("spell was cringe and failed").
