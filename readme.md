# Custom Magic System Info

The test UI behind the link is trained to turn poetry into pre-determined spells with different parameters. Try it out with different poems and see how  
big of a greatness-score you can achieve. Sufficiently great poems can even have multiple effects at once.

Enter your input to the input field on the left and then press **Submit**. Spell incantations can also be saved to memory.

The model is trained only on English language.
